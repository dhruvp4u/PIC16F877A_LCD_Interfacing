This is the program to find the power.(Program is made on Mikro C IDE )

We take 2 inputs at port A these inputs will be voltage and current.

We use port B as output and connect LCD to it. (LCD used here is LM016L)

For connections reffer the image IC_diagram.jpg (IC credits goes to Ketan Jogi)

steps to run this code virtually:

step 1 :start proteus.

step 2 :Make the connections as shown in IC_diagram image.

step 3 :double click on the pic and connect the given hex file to it.



Output will be as shown in output figure.
